=====

A Python implementation of Predictive Sequence Learning. 

Predictive Sequence Learning (**PSL**) is a machine learning algorithm for robot learning from demonstration and internal simulation of sensory-motor interactions. 

**NOTE:** This library currently only comprise an implementation of Predictive Channel Coding (**PCC**). While it has strong similarities to PSL it is a different algorithm. This may change in the future. 

Dependencies
------------

PCC depends on the following libraries: 
* Numpy
* [Chanpy library](https://github.com/micfe03/channel_representation).
